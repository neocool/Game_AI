# Game AI
This is a reinforcement learning AI model trained on the Hearthstone game. It is designed to play the game at an expert level. The model is trained on a large dataset of Hearthstone games and uses deep learning techniques to learn the game mechanics and strategies. The AI model is able to make intelligent decisions based on the current game state and the cards in the player’s hand. It can predict the opponent’s moves and adjust its strategy accordingly. The program is available on Github and can be used to train your own Hearthstone AI model or to play the game against the AI.

I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
